                    <p>
                        Hello! Thanks for dropping by! My name is Nick King and I am currently living in Houston Texas alongside my wife and 3 children. I currently work as an Engineering Support Specialist which includes the creation of Apps and BI reports along with general process or software support. I received my Associates Degree back in 2008 for Mechanical Engineering Technology Specialization. I am currently heavily involved in the Microsoft Power Platform which has very quickly sparked my interest in going further into development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey into web development began when I started as a mechanical drafter. I always found myself deep in the menus trying to figure out what made a certain program run which always had my curiosity and what it took to create software. Shortly after starting my position I was approached with the question of whether I would like to help with supporting other drafters and engineers with our CAD software. Not long afte that I began meeting more and more people who were in development and I knew I wanted to find out more and where to get started.
